Last week, Dani & Levi gave a talk last week at the Spatial Data Science Conference (2020), where we talked about how to enhance your existing work using geographic data science. We ran through some of the code in Chapter 12, on *Spatial Feature Engineering*, and had a great time in the process! CARTO posted the talk to [a YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGi6hymK320i1WiLmTU4Mp-uyA-2BO5wG), and you can check it out below:
