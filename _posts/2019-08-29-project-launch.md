title: "Work in progress..."

Today, we ([Serge Rey, Dani Arribas-Bel and Levi Wolf](https:/geographicdata.science/authors)) are thrilled to unveil a
project we've been working on for several months now: the forthcoming book
*"Geographic Data Science with PySAL and the Pydata Stack"*.

When we started this adventure, we only had one thing clear: we wanted to
write a book that would help as many people as possible getting started in
Python for Geographic Data Science. This goal has guided key
decisions about the publishing process and the final product. Let's get into
the three main ones.

### Open and (always) freely available online

The book is licensed under Creative Commons, is, and always will be freely
available online.
We see this project as a pedagogical extension of our
efforts with PySAL and elsewhere to build an open toolkit for spatial
analytics. Hence, our book adopts a similar open-source ethos.

### Open development

We will be writing the book in the open. As you will quickly find out, the [book you can browse today](https:/geographicdata.science/book)
 is far from finished; it is the ultimate
example of a "work in progress". We will manage the writing process similarly to how we
work on PySAL or how many open-source projects operate: there's an [open
repository](https://github.com/gdsbook/book), every commit we make (even those
containing mistakes, dead-ends, and attempts to solve a problem) gets
recorded, and the conversation is hosted in the open.

This approach also means that you can not only enjoy the book by *reading* it,
but **you can help improve it, and contribute with ideas and suggestionss**.
If you see anything that needs fixing or have any feedback, let us know by opening an
issue on Github at:

> [https://github.com/gdsbook/book/issues/new](https://github.com/gdsbook/book/issues/new)

Life's too short for releasing only fully-finished and polished stuff.

### Physical copy

For those who still like to touch and feel a book, there will be an
opportunity to do so.
We have secured a contract with CRC Press for the physical book to come out next year under their "Texts in Statistical Science" series.

To stay tuned, you can follow the project on its official site
([geographicdata.science](https://geographicdata.science)), where we will be
posting more information about timelines, progress and related events such as
workshops or lectures.

Happy hacking,

Serge, Dani & Levi.
